# Telecom Churn Analysis (TCA)

This project provides a complete exploratory and predictive analysis of telecom customer churn using Python. The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature analysis, model training, and evaluation to understand key churn factors and help telecom companies improve retention.


## Features

 * EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Visualizes churn patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
 
 * Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.
 
 * Model Training: Builds models using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost.
 
 * Evaluation: Uses confusion matrices, ROC-AUC, and classification reports to assess performance.
 
 * Insights: Draws business insights based on important features and model interpretation.



## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/telecom-churn-analysis.git
cd telecom-churn-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the notebook using Jupyter:```bashjupyter notebook Tel_CA.ipynb
```bash
jupyter notebook Tel_CA.ipynb
```

## Dataset

The project uses a sample telecom dataset containing customer behavior, usage patterns, and churn labels.

## Output
 At the end of the notebook, you'll find:
  * Feature importance visualizations
  * Model performance comparisons
  * Actionable insights to reduce customer churn
